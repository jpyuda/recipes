[Brunswick stew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick_stew) is a thick meat-and-vegetables soup that I've only ever had at large gatherings, usually cooked over an open fire. It seemed like a natural way to use up some leftover pulled pork from the 4th, so I improvised a recipe.

### Ingredients

* 3 tbsp rendered bacon fat[^1]
* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 bell pepper, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 ears corn, shaved (about 2 cups)
* 3 or 4 potatoes, diced
* 28-oz can diced tomatoes, including the juices[^2]
* 5 cups chicken stock
* 28-oz can butter beans[^3]
* 2 or 3 cups leftover pulled pork[^4]
* ½ or more Carolina-style barbecue sauce[^5], to taste
* Salt
* Pepper


## Directions
1. Start by slowly sautéing the onion, bell pepper, and garlic[^6] You can add a little salt to keep it from browning too much; you're really looking for translucent and soft here instead.
2. When the aromatics are where you want them, throw the corn and potatoes in, salt and pepper everything, and just give them a minute or two in the pan to warm them through.
3. Now you want to add the stock and the tomatoes, cover it, and bring it up to the boil. Once it's boiling, take off the lid and let it boil (not too vigorously!) for 10 or 15 minutes until the potatoes are nearly cooked.
4. When the potatoes are about 90% of the way there, add the butter beans and the pork. Let this cook a bit longer to make sure everything is hot and to get it to the consistency you want (it should be quite thick; this is a stew).
5. Just before serving, add the barbecue sauce (or vinegar) and check for seasoning. Serve with buttered bread and beer.

[^1]: When you make bacon, keep the rendered fat from the pan in a jar in the fridge. It keeps nearly forever and is a great way to add some flavor to a dish. If you don't do this, use olive oil.

[^2]: If you enjoy peeling, coring, and seeding tomatoes, you'll want to do that with 2 or 3 pounds worth.

[^3]: Better known as lima beans up north.

[^4]: Pulled chicken would work well, too. Or, really, pretty much any leftover cooked meat.

[^5]: I mean the kind that's basically vinegar, with no tomato. If you don't have any, use apple cider vinegar. I put half a cup in while cooking but wound up adding more at the table.

[^6]: This is a modified [holy trinity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_trinity_(cuisine)) -- seemed appropriate, given the dish's southern roots.
