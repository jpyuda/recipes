Potatoes are somehow overused and under-appreciated. This preparation doesn't take much to
make, but is fantastic.

### Ingredients

* 1½ pounds potatoes (preferably redskin or yukon gold)
* 2 tbsp butter
* 3 tbsp parsley, chopped
* salt
* pepper

### Directions

1. Peel the potatoes if necessary and cut them into roughly equal pieces.

2. Put the potatoes in a pot, cover with water plus about an inch, and put on high heat to
boil. Boil until they're easily pierced with a paring knife, but not yet falling apart.

3. Drain the potatoes, then return to the pot and put back over low heat for a minute or
so to dry them out.

4. Off heat, add the butter, salt, pepper, and parsley, and stir gently until the butter
is melted and the potatoes are well-coated. Serve immediately.
