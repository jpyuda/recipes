An incredibly simple recipe that will make you reconsider a vegetable you probably
dismissed long ago. The caramelization is wonderful.

### Ingredients

* 1 quart brussels sprouts
* olive oil
* salt
* pepper

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°.

2. Trim the sprouts by cutting the stem end off, then removing the outer leaves (and any
additional leaves that seem dirty or damaged). Cut them in half.

3. Toss the sprouts with the oil, salt, and pepper.

4. Put the sprouts, cut-side down, in a skillet or metal baking sheet.

5. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes. They're finished when brown on the outside and tender in the
middle.
