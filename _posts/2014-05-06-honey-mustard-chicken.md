title: Honey Mustard Chicken
---
I used to make in college a lot, although the recipe has changed over the years. It's a
good way to get some flavor into boneless, skinless chicken breast, which is barely worth
eating.

### Ingredients

* 2 boneless chicken breasts, skin removed, and cut into roughly 1-inch cubes
* 2 tbsp neutral oil (like grapeseed or corn oil)
* Â¼ cup dry white wine
* 2 tbsp dijon mustard
* 1 tsp honey
* salt
* pepper

### Directions

1. Put the oil in a pan large enough to hold all of the pieces of chicken and turn the
heat to medium. When it's hot, put the chicken in and cover it.

2. When the chicken has mostly cooked through (this will only take a couple of minutes),
remove the lid and turn the heat up to high. You'll need to cook off some liquid in the
pan first. After a little bit you'll hear it sizzling, and the chicken will begin browning.
After the first side has browned, turn it over and brown the other side.

3. Move the chicken to a platter. Put the wine in the pan and scrape all of the brown bits
off the bottom[^1] and let it come to a boil. You'll want it to reduce by half or a even a
little more.

4. Off heat, add the mustard, honey, salt and pepper to taste.

5. Add the chicken back to the sauce, mix to coat the chicken, and serve immediately.
