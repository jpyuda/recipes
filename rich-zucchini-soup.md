#Rich Zucchini Soup

* 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tbsp minced onion
* 1 tbsp minced garlic
* ¼ cup short-grain rice
* 1 pound zucchini, grated
* 6 cups vegetable stock
* 2 eggs, at room temperature
* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley
* ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese

1. Put the oil in a soup pot over medium-high heat. When hot, add the onion and cook until soft. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute or so, until fragrant. Add the rice and stir to coat with oil, then cook for a couple of minutes.

2. Add the zucchini and a pinch of salt. Stir until the zucchini starts to release it's liquid. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has started to evaporate and the zucchini sticks slightly to the bottom of the pot.

3. Add the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook for 20-30 minutes, until the rice is tender and the vegetables are beginning to break down.

4. In a large, heatproof bowl, beat the eggs until creamy, then whisk in the lemon juice. Using a ladle, slowly add some broth to the eggs, whisking constantly so they don't curdle. Do this with 2 or 3 ladles of broth, until the egg mixture is quite warm.

5. Make sure the soup is not boiling, and then slowly add the egg mixture, stirring constantly. Taste, adjust seasoning, garnish with the parsley and cheese, and serve.
